        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <br>

        <p>This series is designed to help viewers improve their mental, physical, and emotional well-being through six simple actionable practices. It focuses on balancing three key areas: mind, body, and soul. Each practice is divided into internal (what viewers do for themselves) and external (how they connect with others) categories, with daily and weekly habits that are easy to incorporate into their routines.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In these videos, I will share practical tips on how to take care of the mind, body, and soul whether it’s through calming thoughts, nourishing the body, or building stronger connections with others. The tips are simple but effective, offering viewers a roadmap to greater peace, energy, and fulfillment.</p>
        <br>

        <p>I am not an expert, but I will walk viewers through what has worked for me personally.</p>

        <h3>Sample Script (Video 1)</h3>
        <br>

        <p>Hi, I’m Stuart.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Fourteen years ago, I was struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. Today, I’m in a completely different place, and I want to share with you what made that change possible.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Over the years, I’ve tried a lot of things. Some have worked, some haven’t. But through all of it, I’ve discovered six key practices that have helped me stay mentally healthy and on track.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Now, let me be clear: nothing I’m going to share with you is groundbreaking. There's no ‘life hack’ or ‘quick fix’ here. These are just six simple, solid practices that have kept me free from depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts for over a decade.</p>
        <br>

        <p>If you're feeling suicidal right now: please reach out for immediate help. In the UK, you can call Samaritans on 116 123. If you're elsewhere, contact your local suicide helpline. Talk to someone and see a doctor, your life matters.</p>
        <br>

        <p>I’m not offering advice as an expert. While I’m currently studying psychology, my qualification in this area comes from lived experience. I’ve been there, I’ve come out the other side, and I’m here to share what’s worked for me.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Let me walk you through the six things I do to keep myself on the right path.</p>
        <br>

        <h5>The Mind: Internal and External Practices</h5>
        <p>The concept of mind, body, and soul has existed for millennia. I like to keep it simple:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">The mind:</span> managing thoughts and emotions</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">The body:</span> keeping everything functioning</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">The soul:</span> nourishing that deeper part of ourselves</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p>Each of these needs to be nurtured from within and through others, leading to six areas of focus.</p>
        <br>

        <h5>Quieting the Noise – Internal: Mind</h5>
        <p>Our minds often fill with negative thoughts, the “shitty committee.” Quieting that noise helps our well-being. Daily mindfulness and meditation help you reset and gain clarity, reduce cortisol, and improve mood and resilience.</p>
        <br>

        <h5>Anchoring – External: Mind</h5>
        <p>We need others to help us think clearly. Trusted people, a therapist, mentor, or good friend, offer fresh perspectives. Talking it out weekly improves mental clarity and reduces isolation.</p>
        <br>

        <h5>Back to Basics – Internal: Body</h5>
        <p>Eat well, sleep well, stay consistent. These basics keep you energized and stable. Sleep, especially, improves cognitive function and emotional regulation.</p>
        <br>

        <h5>Exercise – External: Body</h5>
        <p>Moving your body everyday. Light exercise boosts serotonin and dopamine, elevating mood and reducing depression symptoms. It builds momentum and becomes part of self-care.</p>
        <br>

        <h5>Give It Away to Keep It – Internal: Soul</h5>
        <p>Help others to help yourself. Volunteering or simple kind acts release oxytocin, lower stress, and bring a deep sense of purpose and joy.</p>
        <br>

        <h5>Connect with Others – External: Soul</h5>
        <p>Don’t isolate. Connect with people every day. Conversation and relationships reduce anxiety, increase happiness, and improve overall health and resilience.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Remember: it’s not about perfection. It’s about consistent, small actions that build up over time.</p>
